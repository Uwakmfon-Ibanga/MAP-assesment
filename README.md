# MAP-assesment

# Challenges Faced
I encountered two significant challenges that hindered my ability to complete the project on time:


1. Technical Learning Curve: As a newcomer to Next.js, I spent a substantial amount of time learning the framework and resolving errors. This learning process, although valuable, took longer than anticipated.


2. Delayed Project Notification: Unfortunately, I received the project details late,the update came on Wednesday at noon, coinciding with my exam schedule. As a result, I only gained knowledge of the project information in the evening, losing valuable time.


# Future Improvements
Given additional time, I would have:

- Enhanced Responsiveness: Ensured the project's responsiveness across various devices and screen sizes.
- API Integration: Successfully integrated the required API to fetch and display data.
- Filter Functionalities: Implemented additional filter functionalities to enhance user experience.


Despite the challenges faced, this project has been an invaluable learning experience. I appreciate the opportunity to work with Next.js and look forward to applying my  knowledge in the future.
